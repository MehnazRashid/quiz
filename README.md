This Flask app allows users to choose whether they want to be quizzed on a topic or on already existing material. Users then enter the topic or the material, and the app provides a prompt. They copy and paste this prompt into ChatGPT and then paste ChatGPT’s response back into the app. The app uses that response to create a quiz, which the user can take. After the quiz is completed, the app displays the user’s score and shows which answers were correct and incorrect.
